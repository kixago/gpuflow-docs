Configure your GPU listings to attract renters and maximize earnings. This guide covers pricing, descriptions, and availability settings.

## Step 1: Access listing creation

In your GPUFlow dashboard:

1. Go to **Listings** â†’ **Create New**
2. Select your claimed hardware device
3. Choose **Create Public Listing**

## Step 2: Basic listing information

**Listing title:**
Write a clear, descriptive title that highlights your GPU's strengths:
- Good: "RTX 4090 24GB - High Performance Gaming & AI"
- Poor: "My GPU for rent"

**GPU specifications:**
These are detected automatically from your hardware:
- GPU model and architecture
- VRAM amount and type
- CUDA cores (NVIDIA) or Stream processors (AMD)
- Base and boost clock speeds

**Location:**
Your general location helps renters estimate latency. Only city/region is shown, never your exact address.

## Step 3: Pricing strategy

Set competitive hourly rates based on your hardware and market conditions.

### Pricing guidelines by GPU model

**NVIDIA RTX 40 Series:**
- RTX 4090: $0.40 - $0.70/hour
- RTX 4080: $0.30 - $0.55/hour  
- RTX 4070: $0.25 - $0.45/hour
- RTX 4060: $0.15 - $0.30/hour

**NVIDIA RTX 30 Series:**
- RTX 3090/3090 Ti: $0.30 - $0.50/hour
- RTX 3080/3080 Ti: $0.25 - $0.40/hour
- RTX 3070/3070 Ti: $0.20 - $0.35/hour
- RTX 3060: $0.12 - $0.25/hour

**AMD RX 7000/6000 Series:**
- RX 7900 XTX: $0.25 - $0.40/hour
- RX 7800/6800 XT: $0.20 - $0.35/hour
- RX 6600/7600: $0.10 - $0.20/hour

### Pricing tips

**Start competitive:** Price 10-15% below market rate initially to build ratings
**Premium features:** Charge more for high VRAM, recent drivers, or reliable uptime
**Bulk discounts:** Offer lower hourly rates for longer rental periods
**Peak pricing:** Consider higher rates during high-demand periods

<Aside type="tip">
Check current market rates in the **Analytics** tab to see what similar GPUs are charging.

## Step 4: Availability schedule

Set when your GPU is available for rent:

**24/7 availability (recommended):**
- Maximizes earning potential
- Higher search ranking
- Attracts enterprise customers

**Custom schedule:**
- Set specific hours when available
- Block time for your own usage
- Useful for gaming rigs or workstations

**Busy periods:**
Configure times when your GPU should not accept new rentals but can finish existing ones.

## Step 5: Workload types

Specify what types of work your GPU supports:

**General compute:**
- Machine learning training
- 3D rendering and video processing  
- Scientific computing
- Cryptocurrency mining

**Gaming:**
- Cloud gaming sessions
- Game development and testing
- Streaming and content creation

**Specialized:**
- AI inference serving
- Blockchain validation
- Custom CUDA applications

## Step 6: Hardware description

Write a detailed description that helps renters understand your offering:

**Include information about:**
- GPU model and memory amount
- System specs (CPU, RAM)
- Connection quality and location
- Any special software or drivers installed
- Your experience as a provider

**Example description:**
```
RTX 4090 24GB system with AMD Ryzen 7900X, 64GB DDR5 RAM. 
Located in Dallas, TX with 1Gbps fiber internet. Maintained 
99.2% uptime over 6 months. Ideal for large model training, 
4K rendering, and high-end gaming. All latest drivers and 
CUDA toolkit installed.
```

## Step 7: Advanced settings

**Minimum rental duration:**
Set the shortest rental time you accept:
- 1 hour: Maximum flexibility
- 4 hours: Reduces setup overhead
- 8+ hours: For long-running workloads

**Maximum concurrent users:**
Usually 1 for gaming GPUs, can be higher for compute workloads with GPU sharing.

**Instant booking:**
Allow renters to start using your GPU immediately without manual approval. Recommended for higher earnings.

**Verification requirements:**
Choose whether to require ID verification from renters for security.

## Step 8: Review and publish

Before publishing your listing:

1. **Preview** how it appears to renters
2. **Check pricing** against similar hardware
3. **Test availability** schedule matches your needs
4. **Verify** hardware specifications are correct

Click **Publish Listing** to make it live on the marketplace.

## Managing active listings

After publishing, you can:

**Update pricing:** Adjust rates based on demand and competition
**Modify availability:** Change your schedule anytime
**Pause listing:** Temporarily remove from marketplace
**View analytics:** Track views, bookings, and earnings

## Optimizing for bookings

To increase rental frequency:

**Maintain high uptime:** 95%+ availability when scheduled
**Respond quickly:** Reply to renter messages within 2 hours
**Keep competitive prices:** Monitor market rates weekly
**Update descriptions:** Add details about successful projects
**Professional photos:** High-quality images of your setup increase trust

## Listing performance metrics

Track these key metrics in your dashboard:

- **Booking rate:** Percentage of inquiries that become rentals
- **Utilization:** Hours rented vs. hours available
- **Average session length:** How long renters use your GPU
- **Rating:** Average score from renter reviews
- **Revenue per hour:** Total earnings divided by available hours

<Aside type="note">
New listings may take 24-48 hours to gain visibility in search results as the system learns about your hardware's reliability and performance.
