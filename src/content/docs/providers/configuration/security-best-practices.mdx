Protect your hardware investment, personal data, and earnings through comprehensive security measures and operational protocols.

## System Isolation

### Container Security

**Mandatory Isolation Requirements:**
- Dedicated user account for GPUFlow operations
- Restricted file system access (no personal data exposure)
- Network segmentation from personal devices
- Process isolation using container technology

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create dedicated system user: `gpuflow-runner`
2. Configure limited sudo permissions for GPU operations only
3. Mount minimal filesystem: `/tmp`, `/var/log/gpuflow`, GPU device files
4. Block access to: `/home`, `/root`, personal storage directories

<Aside type="caution">
Never run GPU rental services with administrative privileges or access to personal files. Isolation failures can expose sensitive data to renters.
</Aside>

### Network Segmentation

**Firewall Configuration:**
```bash
# Essential ports only
Allow inbound: 22 (SSH), 5173 (Web interface), 8082-8083 (Container relay)
Block: 139, 445 (SMB), 21 (FTP), 23 (Telnet), 3389 (RDP)
```

**VPN Tunnel Approach:**
- Renters connect through WireGuard tunnels only
- No direct internet exposure of GPU services
- Each rental session uses unique tunnel keys
- Automatic key expiration at session end

**Router-Level Protection:**
- Separate VLAN for GPU provider machine
- Block lateral network movement to other devices
- Monitor traffic patterns for unusual activity
- Enable DDoS protection if available

## Access Control

### Authentication Layers

**Multi-Factor Requirements:**
- Platform account: Email + 2FA (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- System access: SSH keys only, disable password login
- Emergency access: Hardware token or recovery codes

**Session Management:**
- Maximum session duration: 24 hours
- Automatic logout on inactivity: 30 minutes
- Force re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Log all authentication attempts and failures

### Permission Management

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- GPU access: Hardware manipulation only
- File system: Read-only except designated work directories
- Network: Outbound connections limited to approved destinations
- System calls: Restricted set using seccomp profiles

**Renter Capability Limits:**
```
Allowed:
- GPU compute operations
- Temporary file creation in /tmp/rental-session
- Network access for downloading models/data
- Standard development tools

Prohibited:
- Persistent storage beyond session
- System configuration changes  
- Other hardware device access
- Network scanning or port probing
```

## Data Protection

### Personal Information Security

**Data Classification:**
- **Never Accessible:** Personal files, browser data, email, documents
- **System Only:** OS configuration, installed software lists
- **Limited Access:** GPU specifications, performance metrics
- **Renter Visible:** Container environment, allocated resources

**Storage Isolation:**
- Encrypt personal data partitions
- Use separate drives for rental operations
- Enable full-disk encryption on primary storage
- Automatic secure deletion of renter data post-session

### Backup and Recovery

**Critical Data Backup:**
- GPUFlow container configurations
- Earnings and transaction records
- System security logs and audit trails
- Recovery keys and authentication secrets

**Backup Security:**
- Encrypted backups stored offline
- Regular restoration testing (monthly)
- Version control for configuration changes
- Secure key management for decryption

<Aside type="tip">
Store backup encryption keys separately from backup media. Cloud storage services work well for encrypted backup files but never for unencrypted keys.
</Aside>

## Hardware Protection

### Physical Security

**Environmental Controls:**
- Temperature monitoring with automated alerts
- Surge protection and UPS for power stability
- Adequate ventilation to prevent overheating damage
- Physical access controls to prevent tampering

**Hardware Monitoring:**
- GPU temperature limits: Hard shutdown at 90°C
- Memory error detection and reporting
- Fan speed monitoring with failure alerts
- Power consumption tracking for anomaly detection

### Usage Limitations

**Resource Governors:**
- Maximum power consumption limits per session
- Temperature-based performance scaling
- Memory allocation caps per renter
- CPU usage limits to prevent system lock-up

**Automated Protection:**
```
Critical Actions:
- Shutdown GPU if temperature >90°C
- Kill processes exceeding memory limits
- Block network traffic to private IP ranges
- Terminate sessions attempting privilege escalation
```

## Financial Security

### Payment Protection

**Wallet Security:**
- Use separate wallet addresses for receiving payments
- Enable multi-signature for large earnings accumulation
- Regular withdrawal to cold storage wallets
- Monitor for suspicious transaction patterns

**Earnings Management:**
- Daily earnings tracking and reconciliation
- Automated alerts for payment delays or discrepancies
- Backup payment methods for platform issues
- Tax reporting preparation and documentation

### Fraud Prevention

**Renter Verification:**
- Identity verification for high-value rentals
- Payment method validation before session start
- Behavior pattern analysis for abuse detection
- Community reputation system participation

**Platform Security:**
- Two-factor authentication on all accounts
- Strong, unique passwords for each service
- Regular security audit participation
- Incident reporting for suspicious activities

## Operational Security

### Monitoring and Logging

**Essential Log Categories:**
- Authentication events (success/failure)
- Resource usage patterns and anomalies
- Network connection attempts and patterns
- System performance and hardware health

**Alert Configuration:**
```
Immediate Response Required:
- Failed authentication attempts >5 per hour
- GPU temperature >85°C sustained
- Unusual network traffic patterns
- System resource exhaustion

Daily Review:
- Earnings reconciliation discrepancies
- New renter background verification
- Hardware performance degradation trends
- Security log anomaly patterns
```

### Incident Response

**Security Event Classification:**
- **Critical:** Data breach, system compromise, hardware damage
- **High:** Unauthorized access attempts, policy violations
- **Medium:** Performance issues, configuration problems
- **Low:** Routine maintenance, minor connectivity issues

**Response Procedures:**
1. **Immediate:** Isolate affected systems, preserve evidence
2. **Assessment:** Determine impact scope and root cause
3. **Mitigation:** Implement fixes and prevent recurrence
4. **Recovery:** Restore normal operations safely
5. **Review:** Update procedures based on lessons learned

<Aside type="caution">
Document all security incidents, even minor ones. Pattern recognition helps identify sophisticated attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.
</Aside>

## Compliance and Legal

### Privacy Protection

**Data Handling Requirements:**
- No collection of renter personal data beyond platform requirements
- Automatic deletion of session data within 24 hours
- Compliance with local privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Clear privacy policy disclosure to renters

**Geographic Restrictions:**
- Verify legal compliance in your jurisdiction
- Understand export control restrictions for certain technologies
- Implement location-based access controls if required
- Maintain documentation for regulatory inquiries

### Insurance Considerations

**Coverage Evaluation:**
- Hardware damage from renter activities
- Liability for renter-caused third-party damages
- Business interruption from security incidents
- Professional liability for service delivery failures

**Risk Assessment:**
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Hardware valuation and replacement cost analysis
- Income protection for extended outages
- Legal defense coverage for compliance issues

## Advanced Security Measures

### Threat Detection

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- Baseline establishment for normal operations
- Anomaly detection for unusual resource usage
- Network traffic pattern recognition
- Automated response to detected threats

**Security Intelligence:**
