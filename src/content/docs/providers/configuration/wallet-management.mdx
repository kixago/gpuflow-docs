Configure multiple wallet addresses to separate authentication, payments, and security while maintaining flexible earnings management.

## Wallet Types and Purposes

### Authentication vs Payment Wallets

**Connected Wallet (Authentication):**
- Used for platform login and identity verification
- Signs transactions and proves ownership
- Can change when switching wallets in MetaMask/WalletConnect
- Does not need to hold funds or receive payments

**Payment Wallet (Earnings):**
- Receives all rental earnings and mining profits
- Can be different from connected wallet
- Supports cold storage, multi-sig, and hardware wallets
- Remains stable regardless of authentication wallet changes

**Separation Benefits:**
- Use MetaMask for daily operations, hardware wallet for earnings
- Corporate users: Authentication with personal wallet, payments to company wallet
- Security: Hot wallet for access, cold storage for accumulation
- Privacy: Public authentication wallet, private earnings wallet

## Wallet Configuration

### Initial Setup

**Default Behavior:**
- Payment wallet automatically set to connected wallet address
- All earnings flow to the wallet you use for authentication
- No additional configuration required for basic operation

**Access Configuration:**
1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Settings → Wallet Management**
2. View current connected wallet and payment settings
3. Modify payment destination as needed

### Adding Multiple Wallets

**Wallet Collection Management:**
```
Connected Wallets Display:
├── Primary: 0xA1b2...c3D4 (Currently Connected)
│   ├── Status: Active authentication wallet
│   ├── Label: "MetaMask Daily"
│   └── Type: Hot wallet
├── Payment: 0xE5f6...G7h8 (Earnings Destination)
│   ├── Status: Receives all payments
│   ├── Label: "Ledger Cold Storage"
│   └── Type: Hardware wallet
└── Historical: 0xI9j0...K1l2 (Previously Connected)
    ├── Status: Inactive, can reconnect
    ├── Label: "Old MetaMask"
    └── Type: Hot wallet
```

**Adding New Wallets:**
1. Click **"Add Wallet Address"** in wallet management
2. Enter wallet address manually or connect with provider
3. Set descriptive label: "Hardware Wallet", "Company Treasury", "Cold Storage"
4. Choose wallet type: Hot, Hardware, Cold Storage, Multi-sig
5. Specify purpose: Authentication, Payments, Both

### Wallet Switching Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Connected Wallet (Same User)**
- Connect with different MetaMask account
- System detects new wallet address
- Options presented:
  - **Keep current payment wallet**: Earnings continue to original address
  - **Switch payment to new wallet**: Update earnings destination
  - **Add to wallet collection**: Save new address for future use

**Scenario 2: Returning Wallet**
- Connect with previously used wallet
- System recognizes address from history
- Automatic restoration of previous settings and preferences
- Payment wallet remains unchanged unless explicitly modified

**Scenario 3: First-Time Connection**
- New wallet address never seen before
- Payment wallet automatically set to connected address
- User prompted to add label and configure preferences
- Settings can be modified immediately in dashboard

<Aside type="tip">
Use descriptive labels for multiple wallets: "Gaming Rig Earnings", "Mining Farm Primary", "Company Multi-sig". Clear labeling prevents payment mistakes.
</Aside>

## Payment Destination Management

### Setting Custom Payment Address

**Manual Address Entry:**
1. **Dashboard → Settings → Wallet Management**
2. **Payment Preferences → Custom Payment Address**
3. Enter desired wallet address for earnings
4. Verify address accuracy (irreversible after earnings sent)
5. Confirm with connected wallet signature

**Validation Requirements:**
- Must be valid Ethereum/Polygon address format (0x...)
- Cannot be zero address or smart contract (unless multi-sig)
- Warning displayed for non-ERC-20 compatible addresses
- Confirmation required for addresses not in wallet collection

**Address Verification:**
```
Validation Checks:
✓ Valid address format (42 characters, starts with 0x)
✓ Valid checksum (prevents typos)
✓ Compatible with network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
⚠ Warning for exchange addresses (may not support direct deposits)
⚠ Confirmation for smart contracts (ensure compatibility)
```

### Hardware Wallet Integration

**Ledger/Trezor Setup:**
1. Generate receiving address on hardware device
2. Copy address from device (never type manually)
3. Add to GPUFlow wallet collection with "Hardware Wallet" label
4. Set as payment destination in settings
5. Verify first small payment before full operation

**Multi-Signature Wallets:**
- Gnosis Safe and similar multi-sig contracts supported
- Enter multi-sig contract address as payment destination
- Ensure all signers can access funds for withdrawal
- Test with small amount before setting as primary earnings wallet

## Connection Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues

**Common Connection Problems:**
```
Issue: "Wallet not connecting"
Solution: Clear browser cache, disable conflicting wallet extensions

Issue: "Wrong network selected"
Solution: Switch to supported network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) in wallet

Issue: "Transaction rejected"
Solution: Check gas settings, ensure sufficient balance for transaction fees

Issue: "Address not recognized"
Solution: Verify wallet is connected, refresh page, reconnect if needed
```

**Network Configuration:**
- Supported networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum
- Automatic network detection and switching prompts
- Gas fee estimation for transaction confirmation
- Fallback to manual network selection if auto-detection fails

### Recovery Procedures

**Lost Access to Connected Wallet:**
1. Connect with alternative wallet from your collection
2. Verify identity using previous transaction signatures
3. Contact support with ownership proof if needed
4. Update payment settings to accessible wallet

**Payment Wallet Compromise:**
1. Immediately change payment destination to secure wallet
2. Monitor existing payments in blockchain explorer
3. Withdraw any pending earnings to safe address
4. Update all wallet labels and security settings

<Aside type="caution">
Never enter private keys or seed phrases into GPUFlow interface. Platform only needs wallet addresses for payments and signatures for authentication.
</Aside>

## Enterprise and Advanced Use Cases

### Corporate Wallet Management

**Treasury Integration:**
- Connect with individual employee wallet for authentication
- Set payment destination to corporate treasury address
- Use corporate multi-sig for earnings accumulation
- Maintain employee access for daily operations

**Department Allocation:**
```
Example Setup:
├── Authentication: employee@company.com wallet
├── Payments: company-treasury.eth multi-sig
├── Backup Auth: department-lead.eth wallet
└── Emergency: founder-hardware-wallet.eth
```

### Multi-Provider Operations

**Fleet Management:**
- Use single authentication wallet across multiple GPUs
- Set individual payment destinations per GPU/location
- Centralized monitoring with distributed earnings
- Geographic compliance with local payment addresses

**Scaling Strategies:**
1. **Centralized**: All earnings to single corporate wallet
2. **Distributed**: Regional wallets for tax/regulatory compliance
3. **Hybrid**: Authentication centralized, payments localized

## Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security Hierarchy

**Security Levels (Highest to Lowest):**
1. **Hardware wallets**: Ledger, Trezor for large amounts
2. **Multi-signature**: Gnosis Safe, distributed control
3. **Cold storage**: Air-gapped wallet generation
4. **Hot wallets**: MetaMask, daily operation only

**Risk Management:**
- Never use same wallet for authentication and large earnings storage
- Regularly rotate hot wallet addresses (monthly)
- Use minimum required balance in authentication wallet
- Monitor all wallet addresses for unauthorized transactions

### Access Control

**Authentication Security:**
- Enable 2FA on all wallet providers
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service
- Regular backup of recovery phrases (secure, offline storage)
- Monitor for phishing attempts and suspicious emails

**Payment Protection:**
- Verify payment addresses before each update
- Use address book features to prevent typos
- Set up transaction alerts for earnings wallets
- Regular balance reconciliation with platform earnings reports

<Aside type="note">
Optimal security: Use MetaMask for authentication, hardware wallet for earnings. This separation protects your accumulated earnings while maintaining convenient platform access.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Payment Tracking

**Earnings Verification:**
- **Dashboard → Earnings** shows pending and completed payments
- Cross-reference with blockchain explorer for transaction confirmation
- Track payment timing: Weekly automated payments typical
- Monitor for delays or discrepancies requiring support contact

**Multi-Wallet Monitoring:**
```
Payment Dashboard Example:
├── Current Week Earnings: $127.50 (pending)
├── Payment Destination: hardware-wallet.eth
├── Last Payment: $98.75 sent 7 days ago
├── Transaction Hash: 0xabc123...def789
└── Next Payment: Estimated in 2 days
```

### Wallet Health Checks

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Monthly verification of payment addresses
- Quarterly security review of wallet access methods
- Annual backup verification and recovery testing
- Continuous monitoring for unusual transaction patterns

**Performance Optimization:**
