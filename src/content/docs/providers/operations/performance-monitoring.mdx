Track GPU performance, earnings optimization, and system health to maximize revenue and ensure reliable service delivery.

## Dashboard Analytics Overview

Access performance metrics through **Dashboard → Containers** or **Dashboard → My GPUs** tabs.

### Key Performance Indicators

**Utilization Rate**
- Target: `>` `85%` during available hours
- Calculation: `(Active rental hours / Total available hours) × 100`
- Low utilization `(<70%)` indicates pricing or availability issues

**Revenue Per Hour**
- Formula: `Total earnings ÷ Total available hours`
- Compare against market rates for similar hardware
- Track weekly trends to identify optimization opportunities

**Session Duration**
- Average rental length across all bookings
- Longer sessions typically indicate satisfied renters
- `Sub-30` minute sessions may signal performance issues

## Real-Time GPU Monitoring

### Temperature Management

Critical thresholds for common GPUs:

**NVIDIA RTX 40 Series:**
- Normal operation: `65-75°C`
- Throttling begins: `83°C`
- Emergency shutdown: `90°C`

**NVIDIA RTX 30 Series:**
- Normal operation: `70-78°C`  
- Throttling begins: `83°C`
- Emergency shutdown: `93°C`

**AMD RX 7000/6000:**
- Normal operation: `75-85°C`
- Throttling begins: `90°C`
- Emergency shutdown: `95°C`

<Aside type="caution">
Sustained temperatures above throttling thresholds reduce performance and earnings. Implement additional cooling if temperatures consistently exceed normal ranges.

### Memory Usage Optimization

**VRAM Allocation:**
- Monitor through **Dashboard → Containers → GPU Monitor**
- Efficient allocation: `85-95%` during active rentals
- Memory leaks: Usage remains high between rentals
- Clean state: Less than 500MB usage when idle

**System RAM Impact:**
- AI workloads: `16-32GB` recommended
- Mining operations: `8-16GB` sufficient
- Gaming/streaming: `32GB+` optimal

### Power Consumption Analysis

Track power efficiency to optimize electrical costs:

**Power Limit Tuning:**
- Default: `100%` power limit (maximum performance)
- Efficiency mode: `80-90%` limit (reduced heat/noise)
- Calculate: `Revenue per watt = Earnings ÷ Power consumed`

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
```
Revenue optimization example (RTX 4090):
`100%` power: `$0.60/hour`, `450W = $1.33/kWh`
`85%` power: `$0.54/hour`, `320W = $1.69/kWh`
```

## Earnings Optimization

### Dynamic Pricing Strategy

**Market Position Analysis:**
- Check competitor rates weekly via marketplace filters
- Price `5-10%` below similar hardware initially
- Increase by `$0.05/hour` after achieving `>90%` utilization

**Demand Pattern Recognition:**
- Peak hours: Evenings `(6-11 PM local time)`
- Weekend premium: `15-25%` rate increase typical
- Holiday demand: Gaming workloads increase `40-60%`

**Performance-Based Pricing:**
- High-end cooling: `+10-15%` premium justified
- Consistent `99%+` uptime: `+20%` premium
- Below-average performance: `-15-25%` discount required

### Availability Scheduling

**Optimal Availability Windows:**
- `24/7` availability: `35-50%` higher monthly earnings
- Peak-only `(6 PM - 12 AM)`: Higher hourly rates, lower volume
- Business hours `(9 AM - 5 PM)`: Enterprise customers, steady demand

**Minimum Session Management:**
- `1-hour` minimum: Maximum flexibility, higher turnover costs
- `4-hour` minimum: Reduced overhead, better for intensive workloads
- `8+` hour minimum: Enterprise focus, stable income

## System Health Monitoring

### Hardware Degradation Tracking

**GPU Health Metrics:**
- Core clock stability: `<2%` variance during load
- Memory error rate: `<0.1` errors per hour acceptable
- Fan curve efficiency: Monitor `RPM vs temperature` correlation

**Early Warning Signs:**
- Increasing temperatures with same workloads
- Declining benchmark scores over time
- Higher error rates in mining or compute tasks
- Unusual system crashes or instability

### Network Performance Impact

**Connection Quality Requirements:**
- Upload speed: Minimum `50 Mbps` for responsive access
- Latency: `<50ms` to major cloud providers optimal
- Jitter: `<10ms` variation for smooth experience

**Bandwidth Usage Patterns:**
- AI training: `10-100 MB/s` sustained transfers
- Mining: `<1 MB/s` steady-state
- Gaming/streaming: `50-200 MB/s` peak usage

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Utilization Diagnosis

**Pricing Analysis:**
1. Compare rates against similar hardware in marketplace
2. Check booking rate: `Views → Inquiries → Completed rentals`
3. Review renter feedback for performance complaints

**Technical Issues:**
- Container startup time `>60` seconds: Investigate system resources
- Connection failures: Verify port forwarding and firewall rules
- Performance complaints: Run GPU benchmarks during idle periods

### Performance Degradation

**Systematic Diagnosis:**
1. **Baseline Testing:** Run GPU stress tests monthly
2. **Thermal Analysis:** Check cooling system efficiency
3. **Driver Updates:** Maintain latest stable GPU drivers
4. **System Resource:** Monitor CPU, RAM, and storage impact

**Resolution Priority:**
- Critical (revenue impact `>50%`): Address within `4` hours
- High (revenue impact `20-50%`): Resolve within `24` hours  
- Medium (revenue impact `<20%`): Schedule maintenance window

## Advanced Analytics

### Revenue Forecasting

**Historical Analysis:**
- Track monthly earnings trends
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Calculate growth rate `month-over-month`

**Market Expansion Opportunities:**
- Underserved time zones: International renter access
- Specialized workloads: AI inference, rendering, scientific computing
- Bulk reservation: Enterprise customers seeking dedicated access

### Competitive Intelligence

**Market Position Tracking:**
- Weekly rate surveys of comparable hardware
- Utilization rate benchmarking against network averages
- Feature comparison: Cooling, overclocks, additional software

**Performance Optimization:**
- A/B test pricing strategies over `2-week` periods
- Monitor booking patterns after rate adjustments
- Track renter retention and repeat bookings

<Aside type="tip">
Set up automated alerts for GPU temperature `>80°C`, utilization `<60%`, or earnings decline `>15%` week-over-week. Early detection prevents revenue loss and hardware damage.
