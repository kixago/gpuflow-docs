## Network configuration

### Polygon Amoy (Testnet)

For testing without real funds:

- Network name: `Polygon Amoy`
- RPC URL: `https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology`
- Chain ID: `80002`
- Currency: `MATIC`
- Block explorer: `https://amoy.polygonscan.com`

**Get test tokens:**
1. Visit [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology)
2. Select Amoy network
3. Enter your wallet address
4. Claim test MATIC tokens

### Polygon Mainnet (Coming Soon)

Production network with real cryptocurrency:

**Network details:**
- Network name: `Polygon`
- RPC URL: `https://polygon-rpc.com`
- Chain ID: `137`
- Currency: `MATIC`
- Block explorer: `https://polygonscan.com`

## Multi-wallet configuration

<Aside type="tip">
Use different wallets for different purposes: hot wallets for small transactions, hardware wallets for larger amounts.
</Aside>

### Add additional wallets

1. Go to **Dashboard** `>` **Settings** `>` **Wallet Management**
2. Click **Add Wallet**
3. Choose wallet type:
   - **Hot wallet**: For frequent, smaller transactions
   - **Hardware wallet**: For secure, larger payments
   - **Cold storage**: For maximum security
   - **Multi-sig**: For team or DAO usage

### Set payment preferences

Configure which wallet handles payments:

**Connected wallet payments:**
- Use currently connected wallet for all transactions
- Simplest setup for individual users
- Wallet must be connected during payment

**Custom payment address:**
- Specify different address for receiving change/refunds
- Useful for hardware wallets or multi-sig addresses
- Address validation ensures compatibility

### Wallet labels and organization

Assign labels to wallets:
- `Main Trading Wallet`
- `Hardware - Large Payments`
- `Team Multi-sig`
- `Mining Profits`

## Payment token configuration

### Supported tokens

**MATIC (recommended):**
- Native network token
- Lowest transaction fees
- Fastest confirmation times

**USDC:**
- USD-pegged stablecoin
- Predictable pricing
- Slightly higher gas costs

**USDT:**
- Alternative USD stablecoin
- Widely accepted
- Similar fees to USDC

**Wrapped ETH (WETH):**
- Ethereum on Polygon
- Higher gas costs
- Compatible with Ethereum tooling

### Token balance management

Monitor balances for:
- **Payment token**: For rental costs
- **MATIC**: For transaction fees (even when paying with other tokens)

Minimum recommended balances:
- `10 MATIC` for gas fees
- `$50 equivalent` in payment token

## Security best practices

### Wallet security

**Hot wallets:**
- Enable all security features (PIN, biometrics)
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Regular software updates
- Never share seed phrases

**Hardware wallets:**
- Verify device authenticity
- Update firmware regularly
- Secure physical storage
- Test recovery process

### Transaction safety

**Before signing:**
- Verify recipient address matches GPUFlow contract
- Confirm transaction amount and gas fees
- Check network matches expected (Polygon, not Ethereum)
- Review payment token and quantity

**Gas fee optimization:**
- Use Polygon for lower fees (`<$0.01` typical)
- Avoid Ethereum mainnet for small transactions
- Monitor network congestion
- Set appropriate gas limits

## Troubleshooting

### Connection issues

**Wallet won't connect:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Disable ad blockers temporarily
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Update wallet extension

**Network switching fails:**
1. Manually add network in wallet
2. Verify RPC URL and chain ID
3. Reset wallet if necessary
4. Contact wallet support

### Payment problems

**Transaction stuck:**
- Check wallet for pending transactions
- Increase gas price if on Ethereum
- Wait for network congestion to clear
- Cancel and retry if possible

**Insufficient balance:**
- Verify token balance covers rental cost
- Ensure MATIC balance covers gas fees
- Check for pending transactions consuming funds
- Add funds before retrying payment

**Wrong network:**
- Switch to correct network in wallet
- Wait for GPUFlow to detect network change
- Refresh page if network switch isn't recognized
- Verify contract addresses match network

### Multi-wallet issues

**Payment address rejected:**
- Verify address format (42 characters, starts with `0x`)
- Ensure address is on correct network
- Test with small transaction first
- Check address supports EIP-1271 (for multi-sig)

**Hardware wallet delays:**
- Keep device connected during entire transaction
- Don't switch apps while signing
- Update hardware wallet firmware
- Try different USB cable or port

## Advanced configuration

### Custom RPC endpoints

For better performance or privacy:

```javascript
// Example RPC configurations
{
  "Polygon Amoy": "https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology",
  "Polygon Alternative": "https://polygon-amoy.drpc.org"
}
```

### Multi-sig wallet setup

For team or DAO usage:

1. Create Gnosis Safe or similar multi-sig wallet
2. Add as custom payment address in GPUFlow
3. Configure signing thresholds
4. Test with small transaction
5. Document signing process for team

### API integration

For programmatic wallet management:

- Use GPUFlow API for balance checking
- Monitor payment statuses
- Automate wallet switching
- Implement custom payment flows
