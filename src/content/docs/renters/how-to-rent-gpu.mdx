## Cost calculation

### Base pricing

**Hourly rates vary by:**
- GPU performance tier
- Provider demand/supply
- Geographic location
- Environment complexity

**Typical ranges:**
- **RTX 3080**: `$0.80-$1.50/hour`
- **RTX 4090**: `$1.50-$2.50/hour` 
- **A100**: `$3.00-$5.00/hour`
- **H100**: `$6.00-$10.00/hour`

### Additional fees

**Platform fee**: 2-3% of rental cost
**Network fees**: Blockchain gas costs (`<$0.05` on Polygon)
**Setup fees**: Premium environments only (`$1-$5`)

### Payment calculation

```
Example rental:
RTX 4090 × 4 hours × $2.00/hour = $8.00
Platform fee (3%) = $0.24
Total payment = $8.24 + gas fees
```

### Platform credits

Unused rental time converts to credits:
- 90% returned to wallet immediately
- 10% becomes platform credit for future rentals
- Credits auto-apply on next rental
- 1-year expiration on credits

## Payment process

### Pre-payment verification

GPUFlow checks payment capacity before deployment:
1. **Wallet balance**: Sufficient funds for full duration
2. **Token approval**: ERC-20 token spending limits
3. **Network validation**: Correct blockchain selected
4. **Gas estimation**: Transaction fee preview

### Escrow system

**Payment flow:**
1. Full rental cost transferred to escrow contract
2. Provider receives deployment confirmation
3. Environment deploys and access credentials delivered
4. Usage tracked in real-time
5. Final payment processed at completion

**Refund handling:**
- **Early completion**: Automatic refund for unused time
- **Provider issues**: Full refund if deployment fails
- **User cancellation**: Refund minus usage and fees

### Multi-wallet payments

**Connected wallet**: Default payment method
**Custom payment address**: Alternative funding source
**Hardware wallet**: Secure signing for large amounts
**Multi-sig wallet**: Team or DAO treasury payments

<Aside type="tip">
Set up multiple wallets in advance. Payment processing requires active wallet connection.
</Aside>

## Deployment process

### After payment confirmation

**Typical timeline:**
1. **Payment confirmation**: 30-60 seconds (Polygon)
2. **Provider notification**: Immediate via WebSocket
3. **Environment deployment**: 30-120 seconds
4. **Credential delivery**: Automatic via encrypted channel
5. **Access ready**: Total time usually `<3 minutes`
